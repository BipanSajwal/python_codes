a=45
b=20
print(a+b) #addition
print(a-b) #substraction
print(a*b) #Multiplications
print(a/b) # Division  answers will always shown in float.
print(a**3)# exponents example 40*40*40 it means square cube , generally  multiplication times
print(a%b) #Modulus means remainder of division example 40 divide by 20  = 0 remainder it means 0 modulus.
print(b%3) # 20 divide by 3 = 2 remainder it means 2 modulus
print(a//b)# floor division example 10 divide by 3 answer is 3.333333 but here answer will be only 3. int only
